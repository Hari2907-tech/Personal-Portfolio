            <p class="section-text">The adoption of deep learning algorithms in agriculture signifies a significant
              step towards addressing the complexities of pest management.Traditional methods of pest recognition
              rely on manual inspection, which can be time-consuming and costly. Deep learning
              has emerged as a promising approach to automate pest recognition by leveraging the
              power of artificial neural networks</p>
